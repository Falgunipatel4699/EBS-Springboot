# Deploying a Spring Boot Application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to deploy your Spring Boot application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering that simplifies application deployment, scaling, and management.

## Prerequisites

Before you start the deployment process, make sure you have the following in place:

- A Spring Boot application (source code).
- An AWS account with appropriate permissions for Elastic Beanstalk.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Package Your Spring Boot Application

Before deploying, you need to create a deployable JAR or WAR file for your Spring Boot application. You can do this using your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle). The resulting JAR/WAR file is what you will deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### 2. Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk Application

1. Open the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk.

3. Click "Create Application."

4. Follow the setup wizard to create your application. This includes specifying the application name and environment type.

### 3. Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment

1. In the Elastic Beanstalk console, select your newly created application.

2. Click "Create Environment."

3. Choose a web server environment and configure settings such as the instance type, environment name, key pair, and more.

4. During environment creation, upload your Spring Boot application's JAR/WAR file.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

1. In your Elastic Beanstalk environment's configuration, go to "Configuration."

2. Add environment properties and database configurations as required. These values will be injected into your Spring Boot application.

### 5. Deploy Your Application

1. Once your environment is created and configured, click "Deploy" to start deploying your Spring Boot application.

2. Monitor the deployment process in the Elastic Beanstalk console.

### 6. Access Your Application

1. After a successful deployment, you can access your application using the environment's URL provided in the Elastic Beanstalk console.
